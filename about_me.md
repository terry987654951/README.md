When I finished my AE class at INTO, I just went back to Taiwan, my home country, to have my summer vacation. 
I had a wonderful vacation with my family and my friends. I went to Kenting, which located at south of Taiwan, with my friends.
We drank alcohol in our room chatting with each other. When I was intoxicated, I just couldn't stop laughing, and noone can stopped me.
Although, I was intoxicated, but I remembered everything that night, and I was really very happy.
